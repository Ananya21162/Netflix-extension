# Overview: #
This Chrome extension enhances the Netflix browsing experience by displaying IMDb ratings directly on movie and show thumbnails. When a user visits Netflix, the extension scans the page for visible titles, queries the OMDb API to fetch IMDb ratings, and overlays them elegantly on the corresponding posters.

# Key Features: #

🔍 Automatic Detection: Dynamically detects Netflix titles by parsing aria-label or alt attributes from Netflix thumbnails.

⭐ IMDb Integration: Fetches ratings using the OMDb API (https://www.omdbapi.com/) based on title names.

⚡ Real-Time Updates: Uses a MutationObserver to track Netflix’s infinite-scroll interface and display ratings as new titles load.

🎨 UI Overlay: Adds a small, non-intrusive rating badge in the corner of each thumbnail (⭐ 7.8).

🧠 Error Handling: Gracefully handles titles not found on IMDb or network/API issues.
